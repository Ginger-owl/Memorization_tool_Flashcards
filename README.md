# Memorization tool - Flashcards
Simple command-line app that may be used as a memrotization tool by using flashcards.<br>

## Learning outcomes
Work with the **SQLAlchemy ORM** and an **SQLite** database to create a tool for memorizing. Practice loops, lists, and various string methods.

## Programm's logic
Program offers to user firstly create his own flashcards in formate (question-answer).

After some flashcards are created user may practice them. 

Programm will be displaying question, and asks user whether they want see the answer, skip the card or update information in the card.

If user chooses to get the answer displayed, program asks user correctly remembered the answer and based on this data programm decides, whether this card should be revised or may be deleted.

If user chooses to skip the card, program just skip it and displays next card's question.

If user chooses to edit the card, they may either edit card's question, card's answer or both of the,
or, alternatively, user may just delete the card from the database.

When all flashcards are revised, programm deletes all the cards that are well-learnt and should ot be revised anymore.
